# ADVANCE-REQUIRE
a customized version of require, used to override Nodes require() method,
providing administrative access

## Attention
version 1.0 is finally out, with a lot of structure changes,  
the later provided documentation is only for version 8.0.1,  
i will provide new documents soon (sorry but really busy right now) 

## Info
This came to being as part of a project to run untrusted user code,
so i needed a way to control what the user requires and how

tested on node ver 4.4 to 6.2
